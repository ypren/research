Spring Boot 2.0
Spring Boot 2.0 requires Java 8 as a minimum version. Many existing APIs have been updated to take advantage of Java 8 features such as: 
default methods on interfaces, functional callbacks, and new APIs such as javax.time.
Spring Boot 2.0 also works well, and has been tested with JDK 9. All our jars ship with automatic module name entries in the manifests for module system compatibility.

Spring Boot 2.0 builds on and requires Spring Framework 5.

Some notable dependency upgrades in this release include:

Tomcat 8.5

Flyway 5

Hibernate 5.2

Thymeleaf 3

***********Import*************

Reactive Spring
Spring Boot 2.0 fully supports reactive applications via auto-configuration and starter-POMs. 
The internals of Spring Boot itself have also been updated where necessary to offer reactive alernatives (the most noticeable being our embedded server support).

HTTP/2 Support

Configuration Property Binding

Actuator Improvements

HikariCP
The default database pooling technology in Spring Boot 2.0 has been switched from Tomcat Pool to HikariCP. 
Weâ€™ve found that Hakari offers superior performance, and many of our users prefer it over Tomcat Pool.

JSON Support
A new spring-boot-starter-json starter gathers the necessary bits to read and write JSON.
